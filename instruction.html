    <div class="par2"><h4> 1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.<br>

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.<br>

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.<br>

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</h4>

 <div class="win">
     <h3>HOW TO WIN</h3>
  <div class="p"> <p> Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.

    After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.
    
    You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
    
    If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.</p>
